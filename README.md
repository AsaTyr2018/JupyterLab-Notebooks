# Converting CoLab Notebooks to JupyterLab Notebooks (Windows)

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to converting CoLab notebooks to JupyterLab notebooks, specially designed for Windows systems. 

## Introduction
Google Colaboratory (CoLab) is a great tool for data science and machine learning practitioners who want to work in a notebook environment. However, there are several reasons one might want to convert CoLab notebooks to JupyterLab notebooks:

1. **Offline Access:** JupyterLab notebooks can be accessed and worked on offline, which is not possible with CoLab notebooks.
2. **Customization:** JupyterLab offers more customization options compared to CoLab.
3. **Server Control:** With JupyterLab, you have control over the server, which is not the case with CoLab.

## Status
This is a "work in progress" repository, and I am still learning. Any contributions, suggestions, or feedback are highly appreciated.
